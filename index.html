<title>Epic Dungeon Adventure</title>
<p1>In this project, we created a dungeon adventure game that takes you through the shoes of a knight in search of a princess. </p1>

<p2> You travel through a dungeon, manipulated by a demonic warlock that takes the princess, thereby needing rescuing.</p2>
<space>  </space>
<p3> You pick your desired weapon and fight many monsters through the dungeon, picking your desired path.</p3>
heres our <a href="MathewG15.github.io/the ultimate dungeon.py">Github Repository.</a>
<p4>If I could change something, id make more alternate paths, more weapons, more monsters, and maybe a shop.</p4>
<p5>We struggled to get the alternate paths working. Heres a snippet of that code.</p5>
