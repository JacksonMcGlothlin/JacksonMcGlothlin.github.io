<h1>*Android Project*</h1>
<p1>In this project, we created a few minigames including a plane flying game and a clicking the plane game. </p1>
<p2> </p2>

<p3> You pick your desired game and either fly a plane around buildings and lightning bolts OR, click the plane that appears in different orientations on the screen with a score and time limit.</p3>
heres our <a href="https://github.com/MatthewG15/MatthewG15.github.io/blob/master/the%20ultimate%20dungeon.py">apk file.</a>
<p4>If I could change something, id make more games, a scoreboard, and improve the games to create more levels..</p4>
<p5>We struggled to get the plane to fly in the flying game. Heres a snippet of that code.</p5>
<p6> When screen1 .initialize 
do:set button 1 . visible to true
set imagesprite1 . visible to false
set imagesprite2 . visible to false
set imagesprite3 . visible to false
set imagesprite4 . visible to false
call imagesprite1 .MoveTo x-10 y-20
call imagesprite2 .Moveto x-random integer from 50 to 500 y-180 </p6>
<p1>Here is a picture of the app running!</p1>
